# Logistic Regression

This algorithm is used for classification. It is named after the function used in the method (Logistic function).

Itâ€™s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.

Logistic regression uses an equation as the representation, very much like [linear regression.](https://github.com/Nitin1901/ML-FromScratch/tree/master/Linear%20Regression/python)
