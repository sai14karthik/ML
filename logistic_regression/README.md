## Logistic Regression
### There are two approaches used for Logistic Regression here
#### The plain Logistic Regression consisting of a hypothesis and Cost function
This is implemented both with and without Regularization
#### The Next type is the Logistic Regression using Single Layer Perceptron Neural Network (SLPNN)
In this we consider, Logistic Regression as a singly neuron neural network and implement the code as a forward prop block and a backward prop block
